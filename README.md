# Transfer Info - Cities: Skylines mod

The idea of creation and some functionality are borrowed from [Steam: Cargo Info](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1072157697) with [Source on GitHub](https://github.com/rumkex/Skylines-CargoInfoMod). Many thanks to the original's author(s)!

The original mod have to be completely rewritten (data storage structure inside the mod and saved game, and other things...).
But the main difference - planned to track not only CargoStationAI, but allow the user to choose which buildings have to be tracked.

Too much TODO :scream_cat:

This mod uses [Harmony library](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony)

Sorry for my English.
